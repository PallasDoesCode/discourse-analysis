                        <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">The problem solved by
                        this system is to subject a literary work (in this case, books
                        from the Bible) to basic discourse analysis. Since discourse
                        analysis provides the spine of the system's core structure and
                        logic, a summary description of the concepts involved in discourse
                        analysis will be presented here. In general, discourse analysis is
                        the process by which a literary body or sequence of messages are
                        split into clauses. Clauses are the most basic, atomic unit of
                        meaning in the communication of ideas. Discourse analysis seeks to
                        show the relationship between clauses and the meanings conveyed in
                        them. The words or sequences of words that join the clauses are
                        referred to as conjunctions. Although, in some cases, implied
                        conjunctions may be inserted between clauses where there was
                        originally no words.</FONT></P>

                        form of discourse analysis used in this system focuses on
                        generating an outline reflecting the contents of the source
                        document. This approach is based on the idea that any meaningful
                        discourse can be synonymously represented in outline form,
                        possibly the outline that the original author used in the writing
                        of the discourse being examined. This system also takes advantage
                        of the notion that any well-formed outline has a one-to-one
                        mapping to a tree diagram that conveys the same information. Using
                        these concepts, we developed a system that satisfies the client's
                        specifications.</FONT></P>

                        <P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">This
                        system takes advantage of discourse analysis to parse and split
                        sentences (again, verses from books of the Bible) into clauses and
                        generate a tree diagram of all the contained clauses. This tree
                        diagram may then be utilized by users of the system to summarize
                        and condense several related clauses into a user-derived clause
                        that still conveys most of the meaning of the original constituent
                        clauses. In this manner, entire sections of the source document
                        may be condensed into summary statements that preserve most of the
                        original meaning. The most practical application of this system is
                        as a reference tool, helping a user to organize and better
                        understand meanings conveyed in the Bible.&nbsp; </FONT>
